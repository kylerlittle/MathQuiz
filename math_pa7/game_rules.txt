GAME RULES:
1. There are five different levels of the game, each
   with 10 questions each.
2. The levels get progressively more difficult. Start
   easy & master the basic skills before you move on!
3. Beware: you lose points for wrong answers, but gain
   points for correct answers.
4. Within a level, as you get more answers correct, the
   questions will become slightly more difficult.
5. The division in this program will be done by computer
   "integer division," which truncates the result. This
   means that the result is rounded down. By this logic,
   2 / 3 = 0 and 10 / 6 = 1, as examples.
6. HAVE FUN!!! :)
